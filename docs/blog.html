            <h2> Week One </h2>
            <p>My first week interning with Kate &amp; Co. has been a very informative and exciting
                experience that has introduced me to the company’s day-to-day operations and how the
                team effectively collaborates to meet client needs. I got set up with many of the
                company’s platforms and tools they use to communicate and manage projects, which
                helped me to further my understanding of workflow processes and how tasks are
                assigned. I also had the opportunity to sit in on the weekly virtual all-team call,
                where I learned about ongoing projects and what each team member was currently
                working on. One of my favorite opportunities this week was contributing to some
                graphic design work for clients using Canva. Although my experience with Canva was
                quite limited, I was able to look through past designs and see how the team
                maintains brand consistency through the use of color schemes, typography, and
                layout. This hands-on experience allowed me to develop new graphic design skills and
                gave me the confidence to handle similar tasks in the future. Overall I’m very
                pleased with how my first week went and am excited for what’s to come! </p>
