            <div class="a"><p> The significant challenges when it comes to developing a new website using GitHub Pages
                and PSU WordPress are quite different from each other as the methods of development
                differ. PSU WordPress was created in a way that allows users to create basic blog posts
                and websites without having background knowledge of HTML code. This option is great
                for people who want to create and publish basic blogs without going through the
                process of learning and experiencing the interworking of code. However, throughout
                this assignment, I discovered that there are many limitations to PSU WordPress in
                comparison to creating your own code. </p>
            <p> PSU WordPress may be easier to articulate, but there are many more options for creating
                a website that tailors to your interests when writing code and publishing it through
                GitHub Pages. For example, the amount of styling flexibility that allows you to create
                exactly what you have envisioned for certain elements of your website. Although
                modifying the layout and organizing your site with HTML is more challenging, the
                results are overall more rewarding as you personally decipher the code, figuring out
                which elements work and which don't. Unlike PSU Wordpress, where importing and
                organizing pictures is done with the click of a button. </p>
            <p> In order to code using HTML, there are many basic skills you need to know to elevate
                your website, including coding elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images,
                etc. PSU WordPress essentially writes your code for you by allowing you to use these elements
                without knowing the code for them. Skills I would like to learn to improve my website include
                getting a better grasp on elements like figure containers and layout. I have a basic
                understanding of these elements; however, to improve my website, understanding more
                than just the fundamentals can really elevate my site. </p></div>
