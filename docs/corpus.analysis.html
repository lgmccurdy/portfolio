          <p>  The screen captures below show my findings between Edgar Allan Poe's works and 
            Bram Stocker's Dracula. The Voyant word clusters when compared to each other have many similar
            words including "said", "time", and "like". Upon further investigation using Antconc's KWIC, both 
            texts often use the word "like" to compare two things together in the form of 
            a simile. I also found that Edgar Allan Poe uses repetition in his works to add suspense and
            put an enphasis on the madness that occurs throughout his stories. Bram Stocker however, focuses more
            on descriptive words to paint a vivid picture in the readers mind for them to expereince stages
            of grief and fear.</p>
