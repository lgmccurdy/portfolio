            <h4> White Albino</h4>
            <p>White albinos are pure white with red gill filaments, a close morph of the leucistic type.
                They have light-colored eyes particularly, white or pink, with flecks of gold on thier gill stalks.
                They are sensitive to light and may have poor vision due to the absense of pigment in their eyes.   </p>
