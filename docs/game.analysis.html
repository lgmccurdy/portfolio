        <h1>Game Analysis Style Savvy: Trendsetters </h1>
        <section class="gameessay">
            <h2>Game Overview</h2>
            <p>
                <i><b>Style Savvy: Trendsetters</b></i> is a fashion simulation game, the main goal
                is to provide customers with all their clothing needs while becoming a fashion
                superstar. This game served as a great pastime for me throughout the course of this
                assignment. Not only is this game very fun to play, but it also allows for the
                expression of creativity by becoming a "fashion designer". I loved how simple yet
                complex this game could be with all of its different elements. </p>
            <br>
            <h2>The Game World</h2>
            <p> The features included in the map of the game help create the illusion of exploring a
                world. The different locations, including <b><i>My Apartment</i></b>, <b><i>My
                        Shop</i></b>, <b><i>Buyer’s Center</i></b>, <b><i>Downtown</i></b>, etc.,
                allow the player to experience visiting different areas of the map while providing
                location-specific features. The game also provides helpful commentary that walks you
                through these features after you progress throughout the game and unlock new
                locations. The <b><i>My Apartment</i></b> location on the map is, I believe, a
                really significant part of the game that makes the player feel more immersed in the
                gameplay. Having a location specifically designed as a home for your character
                creates a more realistic world, as it really feels like you are going "home" after a
                long day selling clothes at your shop. In <b><i>My Apartment</i></b>, you are able
                to change your character's clothing and decorate your room with items like furniture
                and wallpaper. This allows for the player’s creativity to emerge, as they can
                customize their character to their liking with the immense amount of clothing pieces
                and room decor. When I get on the game, the first thing I do is visit <b><i>My
                        Apartment</i></b> and create a new look for my character during my play
                session. I enjoy being able to not only style clothing for customers but also for
                myself. </p>

            <h2>Characters</h2>
            <p>
                <b><i>Style Savvy: Trendsetters</i></b> is played from the point of view of your own
                character, in which you control where she goes and what she does. Your character
                interacts with other characters in the form of text dialogue. The game follows one
                storyline, so rather than the player having dialogue of their own, the player sees
                or listens to the automated dialogue of NPCS. There are a variety of different
                characters in the game; you get to know them by talking to them, during which they
                display their unique personalities. Interactions with NPCs are also automated; the
                completion of certain events will bring up dialogue with certain characters,
                advancing the storyline. In regards to the main NPC characters like Michaela and
                Emmylou, the game provides you with dialogue that lets the player get to know their
                special interests and motives. Although some of the dialogue can get a bit
                repetitive, it really helps form a better connection between you and the NPCS. </p>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p> In this game, you are challenged as a player by being able to provide the clothing
                your customers are looking for. If you provide the customers with clothing that fits
                the specific style they are asking for, they will buy the item. However, if you fail
                to do this, the customer becomes disappointed and leaves. You need to strategically
                buy your inventory and maintain a variety of different clothing items and styles in
                your shop to keep your business successful. You make progress in the game by serving
                customers and winning contests at the contest hall. The contest hall is where you
                compete against other stylists to create an outfit that best suits the prompt you
                are given. An example of a prompt would be, "A bold look that will shock the world".
                You need to make sure that your clothing items are cohesive in style in order to
                win.</p>

            <p> The main object you interact with in<i>

                        <i><b>Cell Phone</b></i> includes many different features that provide you
                with useful information in order to improve gameplay. You can view pictures that you
                have taken in <b><i>Albums</i></b>, look up the many fashion terms mentioned

            <h2> Conclusion</h2>
            <p> Although I love playing this game, I think there are certain things that can be
                improved if it were to be developed in the future. The gameplay can get a bit
                repetitive as it focuses on one gameplay loop. I also think the developers should
                expand more on the business aspect of the game. For example, allowing players to set
                their own prices and have more freedom when managing the details of their shop.
